# MWRandomClassGenerator

MWRandomClass is a random class generator to be used with Modern Warfare 2019 Multiplayer. The generator also works for Warzone, however it is not specifically made for Warzone.

## Story
Back in the days of MW2 I found myself using online class generators to have some fun with friends. In November of 2019 I thought to look for a generator for MW 2019, I was not able to find any. Thus MWRandomClass was born. It ended up being far more work than I had ever imagined but eventually my dream became a reality. The generator is far from perfect but I always tried to always work on it here and there. 
The generator has been used by some massive creators and it makes me happy seeing it used to bring enjoyment to others.
